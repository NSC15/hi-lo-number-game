## Background 
The Hi-Lo Number game is my Milestone Two JavaScript Project. I have used HTML / CSS and Javascript in the creation of this. The aim of the game is to achieve the highest score you can by correctly guessing if the following number is going to be Higher or Lower, based on a traditional arcade scenario. The user is able to choose from three difficulty settings which each have different characteristics, for example Easy mode you have five lives to start with but Hard mode you will only have three. Upon losing all your lives, the game will then give you the option to restart.

## User Experience (UX)
## Design
### Colour Scheme

- This project's main colour scheme consists of Green (To emulate an arcade board game feeling)
- Grey / White and Black for the plain and effective constrast.

### Font

- Source = Google Fonts
- I have used the font 'Permanent Marker' with a back up of Sans-Serif for this game. The bold and stylish aesthetics of this font work brilliantly with the game design.
